Tired of the bullshit YT is throwing at your way?
Let me introduce world's most advanced YT client (only for powerusers)

Listen to music, watch videos right from your terminal, also supports account login and home feed....


## Deps:
MPV (probably)
Node.js

## Roadmap:
Account signin (works)
Search Video and play with mpv (working on it)
Search Music and play with mpv (future me)
Search Playlist and play with mpv (good luck)
Get Home feed and play from it (so much work)
Get Music quick picks and play from it (.....)

## Warning:
Currently it can't do anything except login with your account
I am still kinda figuring it out... Heavy development ahead...
More features will be added soon...
